Penny for your thoughts
I've had enough of change
As innovative as it was
It seemed so strange
Don't let it weigh you down it is what we must bear
I'll help you out for as long as you still care

Haloorah hoo
Right now the feel good hit of the summer months is blaring
While we're still young we should go out and be more daring

Heavy are most thoughts when full of common sense
The balance between flexible and pushed against
Hold your ground when advice is unsolicited
Yours should be the only voice inside your head

Haloorah hoo
Right now the feel good hit of the summer months is blaring
While we're still young we should go out and be more daring

So let's go out and be so bold
As to grow up before we're old
So let's go out and be so bold
As to grow up before we're old
