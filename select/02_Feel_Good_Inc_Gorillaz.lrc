[00:34.63] City's breaking down on a camel's back
[00:38.14] They just have to go, 'cause they don't know wack
[00:41.38] So while you fill the streets, it's appealing to see
[00:44.66] You won't get out the county, 'cause you're bad and free

[01:54.16] Gon' bite the dust, can't fight with us
[01:55.83] With yo' sound, you kill the Inc
[01:57.64] So don't stop, get it, get it (get it)
[01:59.84] Until you're cheddar headed
